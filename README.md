# Description:
The simple shell program is a shell that is run in the unix terminal. When the shell is compiled and executed the shell will start.
The shell starts a never ending loop that will wait until the user enters a command. When the user enters a command the shell will search for it.
If the command is found the shell will create a child process and execute the command. Then return to the parent waiting state.
The shell can be quit/ended by typing exit.
